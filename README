(1.2, 1.3, 1.6 can be easily added, I have alternate code somewhere)

THIS IS NOT RELATED TO OR ASSOCIATED WITH ROVER (the company, or any parent company or owner) IN ANY WAY

It is intended to help people repair their own cars.
I do not intend to make any profit or benefit from this in any way.

Please use the Github options to report an Issue/Pull Request/Discussion

This is written in Golang (Go) and runs as an API, intended to work with the main web app on https://rovermems.com/
I will move the webapp inside this repo soon so it can run standalone/without internet access
